# Weekly Challenge #5 - Copy Pasta

**For this challenge, you need to implement a program that you can paste content in a certain format, and it will let you copy this content in a different format (eg: text/plain, text/html, image/png). You need to support at least 3 formats and they must form a loop such that you can keep copy pasting in an infinite loop.** The idea of this challenge is to realize that copy pasting is really flexible and all about processing common file formats.
