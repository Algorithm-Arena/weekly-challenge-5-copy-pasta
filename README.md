# Weekly Challenge #5 - Copy Pasta

**For this challenge, you need to implement a program that you can paste content in a certain format, and it will let you copy this content in a different format (eg: text/plain, text/html, image/png). You need to support at least 3 formats and they must form a loop such that you can keep copy pasting in an infinite loop.** The idea of this challenge is to realize that copy pasting is really flexible and all about processing common file formats.

### Winners:

* In first place, @tobua wins $250 with Chinese Whisper AI. It's a really cool use of all the AI advances. Starts from a text, that is generating an image, which is described into an audio description and loops back to text. https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-5-copy-pasta/issues/5

* In second place, @luisperezphd wins $150 for Gotta Paste Them All. What set it apart is the pokemon battle theme around the idea of copying from colored text -> screenshot -> text. https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-5-copy-pasta/issues/4

* In third place, @nicogs wins $50 for Mom's Spaghetti. I grew up listening to Lose Yourself and this interpretation of the lyrics applied to the challenge of copying words, vomit and spaggheti wins on the creativity aspect! https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-5-copy-pasta/issues/6

* Honorable mention for @evgenyvinnik with Mega Converter. It cycles through code encoded as text, translated to pdf, to image and back to text. The syntax highlighting makes it visually interesting. https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-5-copy-pasta/issues/1

* Honorable mention for @Uzo2005 with copy-pasta. It cycles through various types of images. The drop in quality after every loop has a poetic aspect to it as things decay over time. https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-5-copy-pasta/issues/3

* Honorable mention for @alexlcpereira with Pâtes à la tomate. The interesting aspect is the UI where you keep pasting the variants in a 2d canvas. https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-5-copy-pasta/issues/2
